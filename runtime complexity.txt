FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED RUNTIMES
O(1) constant - Best
O(log n) logarithmic time - Really good
O(n) linear
O(n log n) logarithmic time
O(n^2) quadratic
O(2^n) exponential time (like password cracking)
O(n!) factorial time (worst possible efficiency

let listOne = [5,48,88,24,14]
console.log(listOne[3])
answer: O(1)

let myList = [2,3,4,5,6]
let sum = 0

for (let i = 0; i < myList.length; i++){
sum += myList[i]
}

answer: O(n)

nested for loops
answer: O(n^2) quadratic

think of "N" as a changing quantity
