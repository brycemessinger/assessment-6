ALGORITHMS

What is an algorithm
a set of rules to be followed

algorithms are language independent

example: maze
if able to move left, go left
else if able to move forward, go forward
else move right.

solutions: which solutions does this maze represent
guarantee: is a solution guaranteed? not all guarantee
human doable: can a human do it
memory free: can this algorithm be written without requiring additional memory

pseudocode: process of laying out the logic in an easy to read and understand way, not necessarily in code

Many notable algorithms
you many not need to create a new algorithm, however you do need to chose the one that best fits  the scenario

Not at the junior level 
usually reserved from upper mid to high level engineers like project managers


CAPSTONE
build an app from start to finish
DEADLINE: 1/5
make a demo video to show off the application
ideas: chooose a previos lab from foundations to build on, or create your own idea
REQUIREMENTS
planning documentation
interactive front end
3 main features
customer styling
a connection to a server and makes requests from the front end 
2-3 minute presentation


submit plan
build core features of the app, then add more if you have more time

CHECKLIST
remember you dont need to include every single item! 14 is the minimum
the required items are starred

PLANNING:
-project includes a wireframe for each view
-project includes a list of mvp features *REUIRED*
-project includes a data model

MVP:
app has at least 3 main features*
front end makes a request to the server and hanldes the response*
front end is interactive*
app has custom styling*
(also inlude a plan of how project will achieve at least 70 points

FRONT END
- at least 5 semantic tags*
- app includes 1 view
- app includes 1+ additional view
- styling includes flexbox
- at least 1 view is responsive
- styling includes animations

SERVER
app inludes a get enpoint
app iuncludes a post endpoint and handler function
app includes put
app includes a delete

DATABASE	
project include a seed file or function
app uses 1 table
app uses an additional 1+ tables

PRESENTATION
-discusses project purpose and demonstration MVP*
-does not discuss broken unimplemented features
-recording is between 2-3 minutes
